üëã Hi, I'm Mike

Senior Technical Support Engineer with expertise in cloud automation and RAG-enhanced systems. I specialize in developing efficient solutions using Python and modern cloud technologies to optimize technical operations and support workflows. 


I'm passionate about new technologies and am known as an early adopter.

Currently working on multiple projects specifically focused on emerging technologies and mastering cloud skills, particularly in GCP.

Why GCP? With Google now leading the forefront of AI and considered a powerhouse in the tech industry and the golden standard, I'm investing in this platform. In 2025 alone, Google has demonstrated that it will be at the forefront and has taken over the AI sector with leading technologies such as Notebook LLM and agents for the entire Google ecosystem. Now with the introduction of Google Cloud Sec v1 on April 9, I want to master next-generation cloud security and become a leading Cloud Security Researcher. This GitHub profile showcases select projects that demonstrate my capabilities.
